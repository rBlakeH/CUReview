Our Project is called CUReview. All the code needed to run the final result can be found in branch Blythe under the file bProj. The point of our website is to allow the user to review computer science classes at the University of Colorado Boulder. From the home page you can choose to create an account. From there you will be able to see a list of classes to be reviewed along with their corresponding upvotes and downvotes. From here you can contribute the upvotes/downvotes. If you wish to add a class, navigate to the add class page and input the class number and name into the correct fields. Your class will now be added to the classes page wil intital values of 0 upvotes and 0 downvotes. When you return to the site you will be able to log back using the original account you made.
